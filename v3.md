### V3 Hashlock Transfers â€“ Quick Guide

Short, copy-pasteable steps for sender and receiver using V3 hashlocks. No signatures on stealth addresses; commitments are used to bind ownership via hashlocks.

Prereqs (both sides):
- Run node once to create/load wallet and start networking.
- Ensure the node is synced or running a local chain; mine if needed.

Sender: get receiver address
1) Ask receiver to share their stealth address string:
```bash
./unchained StealthAddress
```
Receiver copies the printed base64-url string and sends it to the sender via any channel.

Online flow (recommended): auto P2P commitment exchange
1) Receiver auto-respond service (in another terminal on receiver):
```bash
./unchained ServeCommitments
```
2) Sender interactive send (prompts for address and amount; fetches commitments over P2P, then sends V3 spends):
```bash
./unchained Send --stealth
```

Offline flow: QR/paste token exchange
1) Sender builds request (copy the printed base64):
```bash
./unchained MakeCommitmentRequest --stealth '<RECEIVER_STEALTH_ADDRESS>' --amount 1
```
2) Receiver creates a batch commitment token from the request and sends it back:
```bash
./unchained MakeCommitmentToken --request-b64 '<REQUEST_BASE64>'
```
3) Sender runs interactive send and pastes the token when asked:
```bash
./unchained Send --stealth
```

Verify balances and history
```bash
./unchained Balance
./unchained History
```

Notes
- If the sender has an old legacy coin without a lock, the wallet may first do a silent self-upgrade spend, then the V3 send.
- New coins minted by the miner are already V3-ready.
